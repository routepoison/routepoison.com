## Using Scapy to perform host discovery (layers 2/3/4)

Scapy is a power interactive Python tool that can capture, anaylze, manipulate and create protocol-compliant network traffic, which can then be injected into a network.

Here we will demonstrate how to use Scapy to perform discover in layer 2, 3, and 4.

1. Use Scapy to perform ARP discovery
2. Use Scapy to inkect and analyze ICMP traffic (L3)
3. Use Scapy to perform L4 discovery using TCP & UDP
